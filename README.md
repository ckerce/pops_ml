**POPS_ML -- A Phase Only Pattern Synthesis Machine Learning API Implementation**

**About:** 

POPS_ML provides a reference implementation to illustrate the use of
machine learning APIs in the development of optimization problems.  As such,
it requires only the PyTorch and numpy libraries to implement.  Existing complex
linear algebra libraries for PyTorch or Tensorflow would allow for a slightly 
more concise implementation.

This code provides the building blocks for more sophisticated ideas presented in the two papers

In modern parlance, the approach generally parallels the technique of white box Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks presented, for instance, in Goodfellow, et. all, *Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples*, DOI: https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572
